# Data Quality Duel

A TCG-style web game built to help data engineers master Apache Airflow SQL check operators. Battle the data quality monster, and learn how to use built-in Airflow check operators.

## Development

### Run Locally
You can serve the project using Python's built-in server:
```bash
make run
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Cache Busting
If you make changes to CSS or JS and need to ensure they are reloaded:
```bash
make bust
```
